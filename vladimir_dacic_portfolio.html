Vladimir Dačic | Official Portfolio

About Me
I’m Vladimir Dačic, a passionate entrepreneur and car enthusiast, originally from Serbia and currently based in Switzerland. I own and manage two successful auto workshops, combining precision, trust, and quality service. From a young age, I’ve always had a drive to build and improve — starting with my love for swimming, which taught me discipline and perseverance.

Experience & Education
I graduated from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering High School in Paraćin, specializing in automotive mechanics. Over the years, I’ve grown from being a dedicated mechanic to a business owner, managing teams, clients, and workshop operations in Switzerland.
Today, I proudly run two professional auto workshops, each known for top-tier service, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
